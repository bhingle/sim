CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /home/viresh/new_ws/src/eufs_sim/eufs_description/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /home/viresh/my_ws/src/eufs_sim/eufs_description where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
